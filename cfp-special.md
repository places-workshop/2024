## Topics

Submissions are invited in the general area of programming language approaches
to concurrency, communication and distribution, ranging from foundational
issues, through language implementations, to applications and case studies.

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

  * Design and implementation of programming languages with first class
    concurrency and communication primitives
  * Models for concurrent and distributed systems, such as process algebra and
    automata, and their mechanisation in proof assistants 
  * Behavioural types, including session types
  * Concurrent data types, objects and actors
  * Verification and program analysis methods for safe and secure concurrent and
    distributed software 
  * Interface and contract languages for communication and distribution
  * Applications to microservices, sensor networks, scientific computing, HPC,
    blockchains, robotics
  * Concurrency and communication in event processing and business process
    management
