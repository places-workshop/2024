The increasingly concurrent and parallel landscape of hardware and software
infrastructures demands the exploration and understanding of a wide variety of
foundational and practical ideas. The **International Workshop on Programming
Language Approaches to Concurrency and Communication-cEntric Software (PLACES)**
is dedicated to work in this area.

PLACES offers a forum for researchers from different fields to exchange new
ideas about these challenges to modern and future programming, where concurrency
and distribution are the norm rather than a marginal concern.

PLACES has been a satellite workshop of ETAPS since 2009, and is now well
established as an ETAPS event.  The PLACES topic is central and combines well
with the main conferences of ETAPS, in particular with ESOP. 
PLACES has had 14 previous iterations; this is the 15th edition.
